I'm working on InterviewLuck.io, an AI-powered interview prep platform with a November 21st deadline.

**Project Status:**
- ✅ Backend complete: 4 API endpoints (company info, salary/benefits, company reviews, interview prep)
- ✅ Frontend complete: Vanilla JS + Tailwind, dark mode, compact/detailed view toggle
- ✅ Loading states with progress indicators (4 parallel API calls, ~20 seconds total)
- ✅ All endpoints use Brave Search API + GPT-4o-mini for intelligent link categorization
- ⚠️ Performance needs improvement: Currently 20s load time, need to get closer to 10s

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI (Python), async/await patterns
- Frontend: Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS
- APIs: Brave Search, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Deployment target: TBD (Vercel/Railway/Render - need recommendation)

**Current Architecture:**
Each endpoint follows this pattern:
1. Runs 3-4 parallel Brave searches with specific queries
2. Flattens and deduplicates results by URL
3. Uses GPT-4o-mini to select top 5-6 most relevant links
4. Formats titles as "Page Title | Site Name"
5. Returns: `{ company/job_title/location, links: [{ url, title, description, category }], total_found }`

**The 4 Endpoints:**
1. `/api/company-info` - Official company sources (about, culture, leadership, social)
2. `/api/salary-benefits` - Compensation data (converts zipcode to city/state, prioritizes Glassdoor/Levels.fyi)
3. `/api/company-reviews` - News, culture, career development (6 links)
4. `/api/interview-prep` - Interview questions, tech stack, role prep (6 links, priority-based selection)

**Files Structure:**
- Backend: `app/routes/company_info.py` (all 4 endpoints + helper functions)
- Frontend: `index.html`, `static/js/main.js`, `static/css/main.css`
- Key functions: `identify_company_domain()`, `brave_search()`, `zipcode_to_city()`, `select_*_links_with_gpt()`, `format_link_for_display()`

**Frontend Features:**
- Job title autocomplete with debounce
- Zipcode validation and city conversion
- Dark mode toggle (persists in localStorage)
- Compact view (2x2 grid) / Detailed view toggle (persists in localStorage)
- Real-time loading progress (0/4, 1/4, etc.) with visual checkmarks
- Colored card headers: Blue (Company Info), Green (Salary), Purple (Reviews), Red (Interview Prep)
- Description tooltips on hover in compact view
- External link icons on all links

**REMAINING WORK - PRIORITY ORDER:**

**Priority 1: Performance Optimization (CRITICAL)**
- Implement caching (Redis or in-memory dict with TTL) - reduce 20s → <1s for repeat searches
- Consider: Reduce Brave `count` from 10 to 5, reduce GPT `max_tokens` from 1500 to 800
- Consider: Pre-filter links before GPT to reduce prompt size

**Priority 2: Deploy to Production (MUST DO)**
- Deploy backend + frontend to accessible URL for client testing
- Timeline: Tuesday-Wednesday this week

**Priority 3: Client-Requested Changes (MUST DO)**
1. Change font to Frasier TV show font (Google Fonts: "Copperplate" or similar serif)
2. Update table headers:
   - "Company & Interview Reviews" (currently "Company Reviews")
   - "{Job Title} Interview Preparation" (currently "Interview Preparation")
3. Filter out layoffs content from reviews section
4. Implement "Read More" popup modal functionality (currently dummy button)
5. Add "Saved Searches" feature
6. Make search faster (general request - ties to Priority 1)

**Priority 4: Search/Categorization Bug Fixes (SHOULD DO)**
1. Job postings leaking through interview prep - Filter URLs with `/jobs/`, `/careers/apply/`, `/positions/`, `/job/`
2. Generic Glassdoor pages without role specificity (e.g., "Associate" pages for "Attorney" searches)
3. Wrong role titles appearing (Associate General Counsel pages in Attorney searches)
4. Duplicate results across boxes - Same URL appearing in multiple categories
5. Inconsistent location specificity in salary results - Should consistently mention city/state from zipcode
6. Company domain confusion - Need override map for common companies (Microsoft → microsoft.com not m365.com)
7. Layoff news dominating reviews box (related to #3 above)
8. Social media noise - Individual LinkedIn profiles (`/in/`) sneaking through
9. Tech stack irrelevant for non-tech roles - Handle gracefully for nurses, lawyers, etc.
10. "Coming soon" locations - Filter Glassdoor pages for jobs with "location TBD"
11. Small company handling - Better fallback when minimal data available

**Priority 5: Polish (NICE TO HAVE)**
- Logo implementation (client has logo assets)
- Favicon
- Remove console logs for production
- GitHub setup

**Priority 6: SKIP FOR MVP**
- Docker/containerization (overkill, deployment platforms handle this)

---

**DEBUG ENDPOINT SETUP:**

I have a debug endpoint for rapid testing at `/api/debug/test-all`:
```python
@router.get("/debug/test-all")
async def debug_test_all(
    company: str,
    job_title: str = "Software Engineer",
    location: str = "10001"
):
    """Uses hardcoded API keys - REMOVE BEFORE PRODUCTION"""
    # Returns all 4 endpoint results in one call
```

Once deployed, this allows rapid testing without exposing API keys in requests.

**REALISTIC TIMELINE (Nov 15-21):**

**Monday (today):**
- Evening: Cache implementation (2-3 hours)

**Tuesday:**
- Deployment setup + debugging (4-6 hours)

**Wednesday:**
- Client-requested changes: Font, headers, layoffs filtering (2-3 hours)
- Read More modal implementation (1-2 hours)

**Thursday:**
- Saved Searches feature (2-4 hours)
- Bug fixes from Priority 4 list
- Final testing

**Friday (Nov 21 - DEADLINE):**
- Final polish
- Client demo/handoff

**REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:**

Previous conversation with full context:
https://claude.ai/chat/eec16113-447c-4734-bf1b-035b4d505947

Key decisions made:
- Chose vanilla JS over React for speed (can migrate Phase 2 if needed)
- 2x2 grid layout for compact view (mobile stacks to 1 column)
- Priority-based GPT selection for interview prep (company-specific > tech stack > general)
- Zipcode conversion on backend using free Zippopotam API
- localStorage for view mode and dark mode preferences
- Title formatting: "Page Title | Site Name" for consistency

**WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:**
Can you give me a list of queries i can use for each family in the job family json list?
Can you outline for me, step by step, your setup for the debug endpoint so i can have you run some automated tests? Walk me through from code generation to hosting so i can get your tests up and running
